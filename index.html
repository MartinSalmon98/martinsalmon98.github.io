          <p>
            During my studies as well as my personnal projects, I had the chance
            to work with a lot of different technologies. I really enjoy working
            on the front-end using React or Svelte as well as the back-end with
            Java (Spring Boot), C#, Python (Flask), NodeJS (Express). I have
            also worked on a few Mobile Apps using Java, Kotlin, React Native
            and Flutter.
          </p>
          <p>
            My bachelor's was focused on becoming a full-stack developer ending
            with an internship at
            <a href="https://www.nrb.be/" target="_blank">NRB</a> where I worked
            on a SPFx Project using React in the Sharepoint Environnement.
          </p>
          <p>
            My master's is less focused on development and rather on theoritical
            concepts like AI (Neural Networks, Tensorflow), Cloud (private and
            public with AWS), Networking (Routing protocols,...), Data (Big Data,...)
            and IoT (MQTT, LoRa,...)
          </p>
          <p>
            I work mainly on Windows but I am no stranger to Linux and Mac.<br />
            Git, Jira, Confluence, Trello, Azure DevOps and any IDE or code
            editor are tools I have enjoyed working with.

          <p>
            My project was GRICOR, a Web Application that helps professors from
            my school to correct and grade exams by allowing them to scan the
            answer sheets and correct on the platform.<br />
            The project consisted of a REST API using the Flask Framework
            (Python) and a React Front-End. <br />
            I worked on this project for two entire years (about 10 hours per
            week).

            AliCoins was the biggest school project I had to develop. The goal
            was to have a Web Application (using Svelte) as well as a Mobile
            Application (using Java) that allow users to create an account,
            trade a bunch of different cryptos and have a chat about different
            topics. <br />
            We also had to develop a REST API using Java Spring Boot to connect
            both apps and we used Firebase to have notifications.

            FlexDesk is the name of my end-of-studies project. I was an intern
            at <a href="https://www.nrb.be/" target="_blank">NRB</a> for 15
            weeks and I worked on an Application that allowed employees to book
            a desk anywhere in the buildings.<br />
            The main goal was to have an application integrated in Microsoft
            Teams and designed especially for the mobile version of this
            tool.<br />
            FlexDesk was a SPFx project (integrated into the Sharepoint
            Environment of the company) and the code for it was in React.<br />
            It also had an Admin Interface that allowed the company to have
            reports about the occupancy of the company's buildings.

          <h1>Quark - AI</h1>
          <p>
            Quark is the name of a project made with 2 fellow students at
            school. The goal of this project was to create several types of
            neurons capable of classifying a given dataset and make linear
            regressions. We created a simple Perceptron using the gradient
            descent algorithm as well as the Adaline algorithm. We finally
            created mono and multi layer neural networks.<br />
            The project itself was created with C++ and we created a python
            library (using our C++ code of course) so that we could use Quark
            inside of Jupyter Notebook.
