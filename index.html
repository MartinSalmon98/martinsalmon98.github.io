            Discovered the computer world a few years ago and I have not left it
            since.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lived in the United States for 9 months back in 2015-16 and then
            started studies that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would.<br />That's
            when I started to become a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently doing a Master's Degree in Computer Systems Architecture
            at HEPL (Liège, BE) and I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Information
            Technology from HELMo (Liège, BE).
          </p>
          <p>
            Passionate about anything close to a computer, I also enjoy
            Basketball, Video Games and traveling.

          <p>
            During my studies as well as my personnal projects, I had the chance
            to work with a lot of different technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel confident working on the front-end (React, Svelte) as well as
            the back-end (Java, C#, Python).
          </p>
          <p>
            REST APIs (Spring Boot, Flask) and Mobile Apps (Java, Kotlin, React
            Native) are also concepts I'm familiar with.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I've also been working on a SPFx project using React in the
            Sharepoint Environnement during my internship.
          </p>
          <p>Analysis - Development - Testing - Deploying</p>
          <p>Worked not only on Windows, but also on Linux and Mac</p>
          <p>
            Git, Jira, Confluence, Trello and any IDE or code editor (even VIM)
            are tools I am no stranger to.

            for 2 years where I had the chance to work on real applications for
            real clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            My project was GRICOR, a Web Application that helps professors from
            my school to correct and grade exams by allowing them to scan the
            answer sheets and correct on the platform.<br />
            The project consisted of a REST API using the Flask Framework
            (Python) and a React Front-End. <br />
            I worked on this project for two entire years (about 10 hours per
            week).

          <h1>AliCoins</h1>
          <p>
            AliCoins was the biggest school project I had to develop. The goal
            was to have a Web Application (using Svelte) as well as a Mobile
            Application (using Java) that allow users to create an account,
            trade a bunch of different cryptos and have a chat about different
            topics. <br />
            We also had to develop a REST API using Java Spring Boot to connect
            both apps and we used Firebase to have notifications.

          <h1>FlexDesk</h1>
          <p>
            FlexDesk is the name of my end-of-studies project. I was an intern
            at <a href="https://www.nrb.be/" target="_blank">NRB</a> for 15
            weeks and I worked on an Application that allowed employees to book
            a desk anywhere in the buildings.<br />
            The main goal was to have an application integrated in Microsoft
            Teams and designed especially for the mobile version of this
            tool.<br />
            FlexDesk was a SPFx project (integrated into the Sharepoint
            Environment of the company) and the code for it was in React.<br />
            It also had an Admin Interface that allowed the company to have
            reports about the occupancy of the company's buildings.
